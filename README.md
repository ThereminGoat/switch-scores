# switch-scores
Hey all,

This will be the home of all of the one-sheet scoring cards for switches that I have stated in prior reviews that I would eventually get around to making. These are being done in order to help introduce my opinions on switches that I otherwise would not be able and/nor willing to write long-form reviews for. If you are new to these scorecards, please check out the Example Score Sheet, which will outline each of the categories and explain where the scores for each are derived from in addition to introducing you to the typical layout format. As well, please check out the composite score sheet to find scores for all switches in one location! 

(There are no promises as to how often things will be added to this list nor to what quantity they will be added. This is supplementary review material, at best.)

Cheers, 
-Goat
