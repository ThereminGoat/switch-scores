# switch-scores

This will be the home of all of the one-sheet scoring cards for switches that I have stated I would eventually get around to making. It should also, theoretically, contain and updated sheet that tracks the rankings/average scores/statistics of all of the switches that I do score, though we shall see when I get around to actually making that sheet. No promises as to how often things will get added, as well.

Cheers,

Please Note: The Everglide Jade Green is actually a tactile switch and not a linear one as I had reviewed. This should show you just how bad of tactiles they are. (This will be edited soon, bare with me)
