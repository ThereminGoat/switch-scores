# switch-scores
Hey all,

This is officially now the home of all of the one-sheet scoring cards for switches that I first introduced on July 25th of 2020. In addition to these scorecards being included as a regular part of all long form reviews since that date, this repository contains a significant number of switches which I otherwise would not/will not review in long form on my website. If you are new to these scorecards, please check out the Example Score Sheet, which will outline each of the categories and explain where the scores for each are derived from in addition to introducing you to the typical layout format. As well, there are Composite Score Sheets in both XLSX and CSV formats now hosted at the top of the folder for convenient comparison of various switch scores and rankings.

Traditionally, this folder gets updated roughly weekly with either a scorecard in tandem with a long form review or supplemental scorecards on 'off weeks'. Additionally, a concerted effort has been made by me to go back through scorecards which are gathering dust in order to update them to a slightly newer format as well as reword and/or rescore them to prevent the content from staling. You can read more about these updates and access the older versions of the scorecards at https://www.theremingoat.com/scorecard-update. 

Cheers,
